# Echo Editor User Guide

## Version 1.1.0
Welcome to the **Echo Editor**, a graphical user interface (GUI) tool designed to simplify the configuration and setup of your Echo Engine games. Echo Editor allows you to define game metadata (like titles, fonts, and icons), configure narrative elements (such as prolog, cutscenes, and endings), and set core gameplay parameters (health, damage, win conditions) without manually editing text files or code. It handles validation, file copying/conversions, and automatic saving to the appropriate directories in your Echo Engine project structure.

This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough, including:
- What each field expects as input.
- How to use interactive elements like file pickers, checkboxes, and textboxes.
- Best practices for saving and loading data.
- Troubleshooting common issues.
- Instructions for reporting bugs.

**Note:** Echo Editor assumes you have an Echo Engine project folder structure set up (e.g., `Working_game/` directory with subfolders like `Text/`, `Fonts/`, `Icons/`, etc.). If you're starting fresh, create these using the Echo Hub.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Launch the App**: The App can be launched through the Echo Hub, please ensure a project is open in order to edit.
2. **Icon and Fonts**: If available, the app loads a custom icon and attempts to use "NovaFont" (falls back to Arial).
3. **Navigation**: Use the tab view at the top to switch between sections:
   - **Game Setup**: Core game configuration (main focus of this guide).
   - **Tutorial**: Edit tutorial levels (grid-based editor).
   - **Main Level**: Configure main gameplay areas.
   - **Export**: Package your game for distribution.
   - **Return to Hub**: Navigate back to a central hub (if integrated).
   - **Test App**: Run a preview of your configured game.
   - **About**: App info and credits.
   - **Help**: Built-in help (this document).
4. **Tooltips**: Hover over labels for contextual help (e.g., "Initial player health - Defaults to 1").
5. **Saving**: Click "Save" at the bottom of each tab. Validation runs automaticallyâ€”fields turn red for errors.
6. **Loading**: On startup (and after save), existing files are auto-loaded and highlighted in dark green (#006400) to indicate "loaded" status.

**Pro Tip:** Always save after changes. The app creates directories as needed (e.g., `../Working_game/Text/Stories/`) but won't overwrite unrelated files.

## Detailed Guide: Game Setup Tab

This tab is the heart of the editor. It's divided into scrollable sections: **Basic**, **Text**, and **General Gameplay**. Use the scrollbar on the right to navigate long forms.

### Input Types Explained
- **Text Entries**: Free-form or numeric fields. Validation happens on focus-out (tab away or click elsewhere).
- **File Pickers**: Click the ðŸ“‚ button to browse files. Supported extensions are validated (e.g., .ttf for fonts).
- **Text-or-File Widgets** (for narrative sections): 
  - Checkbox for "File Path" (load from .txt) or "Text" (type directly).
  - Mutual exclusive: Selecting one unchecks the other.
  - Validation: Ensures .txt for files; non-empty for text.
- **Error Indicators**: Red text below fields (e.g., "File not found"). Fields turn red (#661111) on error, default gray (#444444) when valid.
- **Integers Only**: Fields like health auto-validate for positive digits.

#### Basic Section
These set foundational game assets. Files are copied/converted to `../Working_game/` subdirs.

| Field          | What to Enter                  | How to Use                          | Validation/Tips                                                                 | Save Location                          |
|----------------|--------------------------------|-------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Title**      | Game name (e.g., "Echo Quest").| Type directly.                      | Required; no special chars needed.                                              | `../Working_game/Text/Misc/Title.txt`  |
| **Font**       | Path to main game font.        | Click ðŸ“‚ to pick .ttf. Optional (falls back to default). | .ttf only; file must exist. Copied as-is.                                       | `../Working_game/Fonts/Font.ttf`       |
| **Title Font** | Path to font for headings/menus.| Click ðŸ“‚ to pick .ttf. Optional.    | .ttf only; file must exist. Copied as-is.                                       | `../Working_game/Fonts/Title_Font.ttf` |
| **Icon**       | Path to game icon/image.       | Click ðŸ“‚ to pick .png/.jpg/.jpeg/.ico. Optional. | Converts to PNG; must be valid image.                                           | `../Working_game/Icons/Icon.png`       |
| **Music**      | Path to background track.      | Click ðŸ“‚ to pick .mp3/.wav/.ogg. Optional. | Converts MP3/OGG to WAV (requires FFmpeg if installed). .WAV copies directly.   | `../Working_game/Sounds/Background.wav`|

**Usage Notes:**
- Fonts: Use TrueType (.ttf) for compatibility. Test in-game for rendering issues.
- Icon: Square images (e.g., 256x256) work best. The app resizes/previews if needed.
- Music: Loopable tracks recommended. If conversion fails, provide .wav to avoid errors.

#### Text Section
Narrative content for story beats. Each uses a **text-or-file widget**:
- **File Path Mode**: Pick a .txt (content copied verbatim).
- **Text Mode**: Type multi-line text (saved directly).

| Field             | What to Enter                          | How to Use                                                                 | Validation/Tips                                      | Save Location                                      |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Prolog Text**   | Intro story (e.g., "In a distant echo..."). | Checkbox: File (ðŸ“‚ for .txt) or Text (type in box).                       | Required; .txt or non-empty text. Encoding: UTF-8.   | `../Working_game/Text/Stories/Prolog/Prolog.txt`   |
| **Cutscene Text** | Transition from tutorial to main game. | Same as above.                                                             | Required; use line breaks for dialogue.              | `../Working_game/Text/Stories/Tutorial/Tutorial_completed.txt` |
| **Game Over Text**| Loss screen message.                   | Same as above.                                                             | Required; keep motivational (e.g., "Try again!").    | `../Working_game/Text/Stories/Ending/Game_over.txt`|
| **Win Text**      | Victory epilogue.                      | Same as above.                                                             | Required; spoiler-free if sharing.                   | `../Working_game/Text/Stories/Ending/Win.txt`      |

**Usage Notes:**
- **Switching Modes**: Check "File Path" or uncheck to enable Text (auto-toggles).
- **Multi-Line**: Textbox supports Enter for new lines; preserved on save.
- **External Editing**: Write in a text editor, then load via file picker.
- **Loading Existing**: If file exists and has content, auto-loads into Text mode (green highlight).

#### General Gameplay Section
Core mechanics. Integers and comma-separated lists.

| Field             | What to Enter                          | How to Use                                      | Validation/Tips                                                                 | Save Location                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Base Health**   | Starting HP (e.g., "3").               | Type integer. Defaults to 1 if empty.           | Required; positive integer (>0).                                               | `../Working_game/Finishing/Default_health.txt` |
| **Damage Chance** | Denominator for 1/x risk (e.g., "2" for 50%). | Type integer. No damage in tutorial.            | Required; positive integer (>0).                                               | `../Working_game/Finishing/Damage_chance.txt` |
| **Win Location**  | Room coordinates (e.g., "5,3,-2").     | Comma-separated X,Y,Z (Does not support negatives).     | Required; exactly 3 integers, no extra commas (e.g., no ",," or leading/trailing). Saved one per line. | `../Working_game/Finishing/Required_room.txt` |
| **Win Items**     | Required collectibles (e.g., "Key,Sword,Key2"). | Comma-separated names.                          | Optional; trims spaces, ignores empties. Saved one per line.                   | `../Working_game/Finishing/Required_items.txt` |
| **Tutorial Items**| Items to complete tutorial (e.g., "Map,Compass"). | Comma-separated names.                          | Optional; same as above.                                                       | `../Working_game/Tutorial/Required_items.txt` |

**Usage Notes:**
- **Damage Chance**: Fraction is 1/[your value]. E.g., 4 = 25% per room entry.
- **Coordinates**: X,Y,Z for 3D space. Validate format to avoid crashes.
- **Items**: Case-sensitive; match your game's item IDs. No spaces in names (use underscores if needed).

### Saving in Game Setup
- **Validate & Save Button**: Bottom-center. Runs full validation:
  - Required fields checked (e.g., Title, Health).
  - File existence/types enforced.
  - Formats parsed (e.g., coords split/joined).
- **Success**: Green dialog; fields turn green if loaded.
- **Errors**: Red dialog lists issues (e.g., "Win Location: Must have exactly three numbers").
- **Auto-Load on Start**: Pre-fills from existing files.

**Advanced Tip:** Empty optional fields delete the target file (e.g., no music = remove Background.wav).

## Troubleshooting

| Issue                  | Cause              | Fix                                                                 |
|------------------------|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Red "File not found"** | Path invalid.     | Re-pick via ðŸ“‚; check exists.                                       |
| **Music conversion fails** | No FFmpeg.       | Provide .wav; install FFmpeg separately if needed.                  |
| **Font not loading**   | Wrong .ttf.       | Test .ttf in OS; fallback to Arial.                                 |
| **Coords error**       | Extra commas.     | E.g., "1,2,3" onlyâ€”no "1,,2".                                       |
| **Empty green fields** | Loaded empty .txt.| Delete file or re-save.                                             |
| **UI freezes**         | Large image/text. | Resize icons <1MB; split texts.                                     |
| **Icon not set**       | Path wrong.       | Use absolute path or fix location.                                  |

**Logs:** Check any console output if launched from terminal.
